Before processing the data, QIIME was downloaded and loaded onto GitBash. Subsequently, all the scripts and protocols were conducted with
Cirrus HPC.

1) ssh -l abcdefg@login.cirrus.ac.uk

First of all, mapping file was downloaded from the following Spreadsheet, where everyteam recored their observations and measurements.  
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1crHkjeUj1hfKZ5NhGzcB75cB8p0CME2SNuo0kaUDmNg/edit#gid=0
This mapping file was formatted as map.tsv, which contains information about the samples, including the barcodes, coordinates, etc.
2) scp ~/Downloads/map.tsv abcdefg@login.cirrus.ac.uk:~/

Using the command below, V4 sequence reads from either side of the amplicon were acquired as Read1.fastq.gz and Read2.fastq.gz
3) cp -rv /home/mbaron/2018_02_smb ~

SILVA Reference was downloaded it to my cluster from http://qiime.org/home_static/dataFiles.html
wget https://www.arb-silva_databases/qiime/Silva_128_release.tgz
Then decompressed, to create folder called SILVA_128_QIIME_release
tar zxvf Silva_128_release.tgz

Every Script was initiated with the following setting:
#!/bin/bash --login
#PBS -l walltime=01:00:00
#PBS -l select=1:ncpus=2
#PBS -N 2018_cr_nojoin_no_golay_serial

cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR
#load modules and qiime

#setting temporary directory

# loading virtualenv

source activate qiime1
